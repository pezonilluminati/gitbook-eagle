# Webhooks Quick Start


## Overview

The EagleStatus Webhook sends alerts based on the user's configured services. You will receive a JSON payload only when there are changes to report.

## Setting Up

To get started, simply add a valid webhook in the Integration section of Eagle Status. Ensure that your server is configured to handle JSON payloads.

## Webhook Payload

When an alert is triggered, the webhook sends a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
    "checkedAt": "2023-08-21T14:30:00Z",
    "service": {
      "key": "github",
      "name": "Github",
      "status": "UP", 
      "url": "https://eaglestatus.io/services/github",
      "icon": "https//assets.eaglestatus.io/services/github.png"
    },
    "changedComponents": [
      {
        "key": "github/pages",
        "name": "Pages", 
        "status": "UP",
        "fullName": "Github / Pages"
      },
      {

        "name": "Actions",
        "status": "DEGRADED_PERFORMANCE",
